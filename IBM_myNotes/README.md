# Introduction

If you are seeing this, congrats as you are about to embark onto a wonderful journey on blockchain, namely the Hyperledger Fabric. 

## In the Beginning

A few readings that I recommend:
*  [Introduction to Hyperledger](https://github.com/hyperledger-archives/education/tree/master/LFS171x) 
    *  This is the best consolidation on what Hyperledger is about. It has more than Hyperledger Fabric! The intent is not to finish this before proceeding but really it is for a quality collection of materials about Hyperledger. There is, though no answer, quiz too. I have benefitted from this :smile:
    *  This github package is also a course available on [eDX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-hyperledger-blockchain-technologie) learning for audit (free) or verified (paid) tracks. 
    *  However, if you are just looking for [Hyperledger Fabric](https://github.com/tkokhing/fabric), this link should do the trick.

The IBM Course ([Tutorial A1 to A10](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/ibm-blockchain-foundation-dev)) can also be found in this site www.cognitiveclass.ai. Allow me to share some insights to enrich the learning journey.
