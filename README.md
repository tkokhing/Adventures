# Adventures
Learning never stops, so here are my adventures since making a change!

1. **Re-learn programming**, something which I always wanted to do... Sadly my past careers are simply mis-aligned. 
  a. Python #3
  b. Cloud computing, microservices, toolschain... 
2. Having fun with **Hyperledger** with this:
  a. https://github.com/hyperledger-archives/education/tree/master/LFS171x/docs
3. **IBM_myNotes** can improve for better clarity, here are my observations.
