# Adventures
Learning never stops, so here are my adventures since making a change!

1. **Re-learn programming**, something which I always wanted to do... Sadly my past careers are simply mis-aligned.
  * [Python #3](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/)
  * Cloud computing, microservices, toolschain... 
2. Having fun with **Hyperledger Blockchain** with this:
  * [Introduction to Hyperledger Blockchain Technologies
](https://github.com/hyperledger-archives/education/tree/master/LFS171x/docs) on edX
  * With the small achievement in building a blockchain of 3 Orgs, I have chart [what is next for me](https://github.com/tkokhing/OneHeart#whats-next-for-me) in Fabric. So [here](https://github.com/tkokhing/playtime_HyperledgerFabric/blob/main/README.md) is the progress thus far. 
3. **IBM Tutorials** that I used for reference can improve for better clarity. This tends to be the case as tutorials, like many others out there, are written by experts which novice like myself would have diffculty to level up. So [here](https://github.com/tkokhing/Adventures/tree/main/IBM_myNotes) are my observations from the novice eyes.
